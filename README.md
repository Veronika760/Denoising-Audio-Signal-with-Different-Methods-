# Denoising-Audio-Signal-with-Different-Methods-

In this project I tried 3 Methods to Desoine an audio signal which a girl talking with Music in the Background.
The methods that I have used:
- Fast Fourier Transform and Low Pass Filter
- Built in Function Filter Designer From Matlab with frequency cut off 1000
- Wavelet Decomposition Filter

The result shows the Built in Filter Designer perform better than others.
